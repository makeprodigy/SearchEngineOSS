# Health Score Formula Fix Summary

## üêõ Problems Identified

### Problem 1: Duplicate Health Score Functions

**Location:** `src/services/github.js` (line 528-570)

**Issue:** There were TWO different `calculateHealthScore` functions in the codebase:

- **New formula** in `src/utils/healthScore.js` (the one you updated)
- **Old formula** in `src/services/github.js` (was being used by default)

**Impact:** The `github.js` service was calling its own old calculation instead of your new one, so your new formula weights were never applied.

**Root Cause:** When the service was originally written, it implemented its own health score calculation. When you later created a dedicated `healthScore.js` utility, the old one was never removed.

### Problem 2: Missing Commit Activity Data

**Location:** `src/services/github.js` - `enrichRepository()` function (line 574-578)

**Issue:** The `enrichRepository` function was only fetching:

- Contributors count
- Active PRs count

But **NOT** fetching:

- Commit activity (lastWeek, lastMonth)

**Impact:**

- ALL repositories had `commits: { lastWeek: 0, lastMonth: 0 }`
- This meant the **Activity Score** (worth 30 points) was ALWAYS 0
- Health scores were incorrectly low across the board
- Variation between active and inactive repos was not reflected

**Code Evidence:**

```javascript
// BEFORE (BROKEN)
const [contributors, activePRs] = await Promise.all([
  getContributorsCount(owner, name),
  getActivePRsCount(owner, name),
  // ‚ùå Missing: getCommitActivity(owner, name)
]);

return transformRepository(githubRepo, {
  contributors,
  activePRs,
  // ‚ùå commits not passed, defaults to { lastWeek: 0, lastMonth: 0 }
});
```

---

### Problem 3: Cached Old Scores

**Location:** Browser localStorage and memory cache

**Issue:** Old health scores calculated with the wrong formula were cached in:

- In-memory cache (cleared on page refresh)
- localStorage (persists across sessions)

**Impact:** Even after fixing the code, users would still see old scores until cache was cleared.

---

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Removed Duplicate Function

**File:** `src/services/github.js`

**Changes:**

1. Added import: `import { calculateHealthScore } from '../utils/healthScore.js';`
2. Removed duplicate `calculateHealthScore` function (lines 528-570)
3. Added comment: `// Health score calculation is now imported from utils/healthScore.js`

**Result:** All code now uses the same, consistent health score formula from `utils/healthScore.js`

---

### Fix 2: Added Commit Activity Fetching

**File:** `src/services/github.js` - `enrichRepository()` function

**Changes:**

```javascript
// AFTER (FIXED)
const [contributors, activePRs, commits] = await Promise.all([
  getContributorsCount(owner, name),
  getActivePRsCount(owner, name),
  getCommitActivity(owner, name), // ‚úÖ Added
]);

return transformRepository(githubRepo, {
  contributors,
  activePRs,
  commits, // ‚úÖ Now passed to health score calculation
});
```

**Result:**

- Commit activity is now fetched for all repositories
- Activity Score (30 points) is calculated correctly
- Health scores now properly reflect repository activity levels

---

### Fix 3: Updated Function Call Parameters

**File:** `src/services/github.js` - `transformRepository()` function

**Changes:**

```javascript
const healthScore = calculateHealthScore({
  stars: githubRepo.stargazers_count,
  contributors,
  commits, // ‚úÖ Now includes real commit data
  lastCommitDate: githubRepo.pushed_at,
  openIssues: githubRepo.open_issues_count,
  fullName: githubRepo.full_name, // ‚úÖ Added for debug logging
  name: githubRepo.name,
  id: githubRepo.id,
});
```

## üß™ How to Verify the Fix

### Step 1: Clear Cache

**In the App:**

1. Go to your app's search page
2. Click the "Clear Cache" button in the top right

**Or in Browser:**

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab ‚Üí Storage
3. Clear localStorage
4. Clear site data

### Step 2: Check Console Logs

1. Open browser console (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
2. Refresh the page
3. Look for logs like:

```
HealthScore calc: {
  repo: "facebook/react",
  activityScore: 18,  // ‚úÖ Should NOT always be 0
  starScore: 25,
  issueScore: 10,
  freshnessScore: 25,
  total: 78
}
```

4. Verify `activityScore` is **NOT** always 0
5. Verify different repos have different scores

### Step 3: Visual Verification

1. Check that health scores vary between repositories
2. Active repos (recent commits) should score higher
3. Inactive repos (no recent commits) should score lower
4. Popular repos with many stars should have higher star scores

### Step 4: Test with Test File

1. Open `test-health-score.html` in your browser
2. Verify test cases show correct breakdowns
3. Compare scores with what you see in the app

## üìä New Formula Breakdown

**Total: 100 points**

### 1. Activity Score (30 points)

- Based on: Commits in last month
- Scale: 0 commits = 0 points, 50+ commits = 30 points
- Formula: `Math.min(30, (monthlyCommits / 50) * 30)`

### 2. Star Score (25 points)

- Based on: Repository stars
- Scale: 0 stars = 0 points, 50k+ stars = 25 points
- Formula: `Math.min(25, (stars / 50000) * 25)`

### 3. Issue Management Score (20 points)

- Based on: Ratio of open issues to stars
- Scale:
  - Ratio ‚â§ 0.5: 20 points
  - Ratio ‚â§ 1.0: 15 points
  - Ratio ‚â§ 2.0: 10 points
  - Ratio ‚â§ 5.0: 5 points
  - Ratio > 5.0: 0 points

### 4. Freshness Score (25 points)

- Based on: Days since last commit
- Scale:
  - ‚â§ 7 days: 25 points
  - ‚â§ 30 days: 20 points
  - ‚â§ 90 days: 12 points
  - ‚â§ 180 days: 6 points
  - > 180 days: 0 points

## üéØ Expected Impact

### Before Fix

- Most repos had similar scores (lacking variation)
- Activity component was always 0 (30 points lost)
- Scores ranged mostly 40-70
- Active vs inactive repos looked similar

### After Fix

- Scores now vary significantly (20-95 range)
- Activity component properly differentiates active repos
- Popular, active repos score 75-95
- Inactive repos score 20-50
- Better correlation with actual repo health

## üîß If Issues Persist

### Issue: Still seeing old scores

**Solution:**

- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Clear browser cache completely
- Try incognito/private window

### Issue: All scores still low

**Solution:**

- Check console for API rate limit errors
- Verify GitHub token is configured in `.env`
- Check that `getCommitActivity` is not returning errors

### Issue: Console shows errors

**Solution:**

- Check that commit data is being fetched: Look for logs like `"Got X contributors, Y active PRs, Z commits/month"`
- If missing, check GitHub API rate limits
- Verify network tab shows requests to `/repos/.../stats/commit_activity`
