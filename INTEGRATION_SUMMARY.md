# GitHub API Integration Summary

## What's New? ðŸŽ‰

Your OSS Discovery Engine now uses the **GitHub REST API** to fetch real-time repository data!

## Changes Made

### 1. New GitHub API Service (`src/services/github.js`)

A comprehensive service that handles:

- âœ… Repository search with filters
- âœ… Fetching trending and popular repositories
- âœ… Getting repository details (contributors, commits, good first issues)
- âœ… Intelligent caching (5 minutes) to reduce API calls
- âœ… Rate limiting to respect GitHub API limits
- âœ… Data transformation to match your app's data structure
- âœ… Optional GitHub token support for higher rate limits

### 2. Debounce Hook (`src/hooks/useDebounce.js`)

- Custom hook for debouncing search queries and filter changes
- 500ms delay to avoid excessive API calls
- Enables real-time filtering without overwhelming the API

### 3. Updated SearchPage (`src/pages/SearchPage.jsx`)

**New Features:**

- Real-time search with debouncing
- Live filtering as you type or change filters
- Loading states with spinner
- Error handling with retry option
- Toggle to switch between GitHub API and mock data (for development)
- All filters work in real-time: language, license, stars, health score, etc.

### 4. Updated LandingPage (`src/pages/LandingPage.jsx`)

**New Features:**

- Fetches popular repositories from GitHub (top starred)
- Fetches trending repositories (recently popular)
- Personalized recommendations based on user's tech stack
- Loading state while fetching data
- All data is live from GitHub API

### 5. Documentation

- `GITHUB_API_SETUP.md` - Detailed setup guide
- `README.md` - Updated with GitHub API information
- `INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file!

## How to Use

### Without GitHub Token (60 requests/hour)

Just start the app - it works out of the box!

```bash
npm run dev
```

### With GitHub Token (5000 requests/hour) - Recommended

1. Create `.env` file in project root:

```env
VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
```

2. Get your token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens

   - Create "Personal access token (classic)"
   - Select scope: `public_repo`
   - Copy the token

3. Restart your dev server

## Features in Action

### Real-Time Search

1. Go to Search page
2. Start typing in the search bar
3. Results update automatically after 500ms
4. Try: "react", "machine learning", "web framework"

### Real-Time Filtering

1. On Search page, use the sidebar filters
2. Select languages: JavaScript, Python, TypeScript
3. Set minimum stars: 10000
4. Choose health score: Excellent (90+)
5. Results update automatically as you change filters!

### Landing Page

1. Popular Projects - Top starred repos on GitHub
2. Trending - Recently popular repositories
3. Recommended - Based on your tech stack (set in onboarding/profile)

### Toggle Mode (Development)

On the Search page, you can toggle between:

- **GitHub API** (default) - Live data
- **Mock Data** - Cached data for development

## API Rate Limits

### Without Token

- 60 requests per hour per IP address
- Sufficient for light usage and testing

### With Token

- 5,000 requests per hour
- Recommended for regular use
- Required for heavy testing/development

### How We Optimize

- **Caching**: Results cached for 5 minutes
- **Debouncing**: Wait 500ms before searching
- **Rate Limiting**: Minimum 1 second between requests
- **Smart Fetching**: Only fetch what's needed

## Error Handling

The app gracefully handles:

- Rate limit errors (shows reset time)
- Network errors (shows retry button)
- API errors (falls back to empty results)
- Missing data (uses sensible defaults)

## Data Structure

GitHub API data is transformed to match your app's format:

- Repository details (name, description, URL)
- Stats (stars, forks, watchers, issues)
- Community (contributors, good first issues)
- Activity (commit history, last commit date)
- Health score (calculated from multiple factors)
- Tech stack (language, topics/tags)

## Performance

### Optimizations Applied

1. **Parallel Requests**: Multiple repos fetched simultaneously
2. **Lazy Loading**: Additional data fetched only when needed
3. **Smart Caching**: Reduce redundant API calls
4. **Debouncing**: Avoid excessive search requests
5. **Rate Limiting**: Respect GitHub's limits

### Expected Performance

- Search: ~1-2 seconds (first time)
- Search: ~100ms (cached)
- Landing Page: ~2-3 seconds (initial load)
- Filters: Instant (real-time)

## Troubleshooting

### "Rate limit exceeded"

- Wait for the reset time shown in error
- Add a GitHub token to your `.env` file
- Toggle to mock data temporarily

### Slow searches

- Add a GitHub token (increases priority)
- Use more specific search queries
- Apply filters to narrow results

### No results

- Check internet connection
- Verify search query is valid
- Try broader search terms
- Check browser console for errors

### Token not working

- Verify token is in `.env` file as `VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN`
- Restart dev server after adding token
- Check token has `public_repo` scope
- Verify token hasn't expired

## Architecture

```

    â†“

## Next Steps

Want to extend the integration?

1. **Add More Filters**: Modify `searchWithFilters()` in `github.js`
2. **Fetch More Data**: Add functions to get PRs, issues, commits
3. **Better Caching**: Implement persistent cache (localStorage)
4. **Pagination**: Add pagination for large result sets
5. **Advanced Search**: Use GitHub's advanced search syntax
